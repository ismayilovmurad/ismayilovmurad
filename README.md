I've been coding since 2018. I started learning how to code with HTML and CSS, and after a couple of months, I did some internet research, which led me to take a Python course on Udemy. After learning the basics of Python, I realized I needed to choose a more specific field and learn the required technologies. My second online course was a Web development course with the C# programming language and ASP.NET framework. But after a while, I decided to go with app development, which I'm more passionate about. I learned the Java programming language, took another course for learning Android development, started building Android apps, and then published some of them on Google Play Store.

After a few months, I started freelancing on Upwork. I've done some tasks on Upwork, like building Android apps from scratch, fixing bugs, changing the UI in the existing Android apps, etc. I received over twenty "5-star" reviews and earned the "Top Rated" badge on Upwork. I also have worked on projects unrelated to app development, like translation, proofreading, transcription, QA testing in AI projects, team leading, etc.

I started working as an iOS developer at a local company in 2021. Since then, besides working as an iOS developer, I worked with some companies as a Team leader and a QA tester (proofreading, transcription, checking the audio quality, labeling the categories, etc.) in AI projects. I plan to focus only on the app development career and master iOS development. Currently, I'm working on my own app (launched on App Store) and reading books about iOS development to improve my skills.
